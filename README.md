# üìò SOLID Principles in PHP

This repository demonstrates the **SOLID principles** using real-world **Payment System** examples in PHP.  
Each principle contains both a **bad example (violation)** and a **good example (refactored)**, along with a `README.md` explaining the principle.

## üîë What are SOLID Principles?
SOLID is an acronym for **five design principles** that help developers create maintainable, scalable, and testable software:

1. **S** ‚Äì Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
2. **O** ‚Äì Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
3. **L** ‚Äì Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
4. **I** ‚Äì Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
5. **D** ‚Äì Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## üìö Principles Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](src/SRP/README.md)
> A class should have only one reason to change.  
- ‚ùå Bad: `PaymentProcessor` does payment + DB save + logging + email.  
- ‚úÖ Good: Each responsibility is separated (`PaymentProcessor`, `PaymentRepository`, `Logger`, `EmailNotifier`).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](src/OCP/README.md)
> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  
- ‚ùå Bad: Adding a new payment method requires modifying `PaymentProcessor`.  
- ‚úÖ Good: `PaymentProcessor` depends on `PaymentMethod` interface ‚Üí easily extend with `StripePayment`, `PayPalPayment`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](src/LSP/README.md)
> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.  
- ‚ùå Bad: `PayPalPayment` forced to implement unsupported methods (`buyNowPayLater`) ‚Üí runtime errors.  
- ‚úÖ Good: Split abstractions. `StripePayment` supports BNPL, `PayPalPayment` does not, avoiding invalid substitutions.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](src/ISP/README.md)
> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.  
- ‚ùå Bad: One big `IPaymentMethod` forces all methods on every provider.  
- ‚úÖ Good: Smaller interfaces (`IPaymentMethod`, `IRefundable`, `IRecurringPayment`) ‚Üí providers only implement what they support.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](src/DIP/README.md)
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
- ‚ùå Bad: `PaymentProcessor` directly creates `StripePayment`.  
- ‚úÖ Good: `PaymentProcessor` depends on `IPaymentMethod` interface ‚Üí actual implementation injected at runtime.

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Install dependencies (only `composer` autoloading is used):
    ```bash
    composer dump-autoload
    ```
---

2. Run individual demos:

   ```bash
   php demo/SrpDemo.php
   php demo/OcpDemo.php
   php demo/LspDemo.php
   php demo/IspDemo.php
   php demo/DipDemo.php
   ```

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Following SOLID

* Cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
* Easy to extend with new features.
* Better testability (thanks to abstractions and dependency injection).
* Aligns with modern frameworks (Laravel, Symfony) and Clean Architecture practices.
