# üìò SOLID Principles in PHP

This repository demonstrates the **SOLID principles** using real-world **Payment System** examples in PHP.  
Each principle contains both a **bad example (violation)** and a **good example (refactored)**, along with a `README.md` explaining the principle.

---

## üîë What are SOLID Principles?
The **SOLID principles** are five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create software that is more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. They were first introduced by **Robert C. Martin** (Uncle Bob) and are a cornerstone of modern software design.

Applying these principles leads to code that is easier to refactor, test, and understand.


* **S - Single Responsibility Principle:** A class should have only one reason to change.
* **O - Open-Closed Principle:** A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* **L - Liskov Substitution Principle:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
* **I - Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
* **D - Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## üìö Principles Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](src/SRP/README.md)
> A class should have only one reason to change.  
- ‚ùå Bad: `PaymentProcessor` does payment + DB save + logging + email.  
- ‚úÖ Good: Each responsibility is separated (`PaymentProcessor`, `PaymentRepository`, `Logger`, `EmailNotifier`).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](src/OCP/README.md)
> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  
- ‚ùå Bad: Adding a new payment method requires modifying `PaymentProcessor`.  
- ‚úÖ Good: `PaymentProcessor` depends on `PaymentMethod` interface ‚Üí easily extend with `StripePayment`, `PayPalPayment`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](src/LSP/README.md)
> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.  
- ‚ùå Bad: `PayPalPayment` forced to implement unsupported methods (`buyNowPayLater`) ‚Üí runtime errors.  
- ‚úÖ Good: Split abstractions. `StripePayment` supports BNPL, `PayPalPayment` does not, avoiding invalid substitutions.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](src/ISP/README.md)
> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.  
- ‚ùå Bad: One big `IPaymentMethod` forces all methods on every provider.  
- ‚úÖ Good: Smaller interfaces (`IPaymentMethod`, `IRefundable`, `IRecurringPayment`) ‚Üí providers only implement what they support.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](src/DIP/README.md)
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
- ‚ùå Bad: `PaymentProcessor` directly creates `StripePayment`.  
- ‚úÖ Good: `PaymentProcessor` depends on `IPaymentMethod` interface ‚Üí actual implementation injected at runtime.

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Install dependencies (only `composer` autoloading is used):
    ```bash
    composer dump-autoload
    ```
---

2. Run individual demos:

   ```bash
   php demo/SrpDemo.php
   php demo/OcpDemo.php
   php demo/LspDemo.php
   php demo/IspDemo.php
   php demo/DipDemo.php
   ```

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Following SOLID

* Cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
* Easy to extend with new features.
* Better testability (thanks to abstractions and dependency injection).
* Aligns with modern frameworks (Laravel, Symfony) and Clean Architecture practices.
